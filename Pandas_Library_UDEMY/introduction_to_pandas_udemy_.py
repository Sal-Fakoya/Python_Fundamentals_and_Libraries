                            ABOUT PANDAS
--> Pandas is built on top of NumPy.
--> Pandas is used for data manipulation, focused on tabular and time series data.
--> In Pandas, we work with rows and columns, and use labels to identify rows and columns in addition to positional
indices.
--> In Pandas, The columns in the same array CAN have different data types unlike NumPy where arrays must have the
same data type.
--> Pandas is a huge library that has lots of data querying and manipulation functionality.

                            KEY OBJECTS IN PANDAS LIBRARY
--> Series : are one dimensional arrays
--> DataFrame : is a 2-Dimensional array. It is essentially a collection of Series objects, where series are the
columns in the DataFrame
--> Index : used to index Series and DataFrame objects. This is one of the key differences between Pandas and NumPy.
    --> NumPy array elements are indexed implicitly by position while Pandas have labels that form a series.
    --> In Pandas, we can assign explicit labels to a series (or columns) and rows in the DataFrame.
